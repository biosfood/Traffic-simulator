# Traffic simulator

For school, I have to write a (pseudo-) scientific paper with the theme 'everyday physics'. I chose to focus on the topic of urban interchanges and the effects different variables might have on their effectivenes. Because a
traditional experiment would be far too expensive / much work, I created this simulation to do my research.

This project was made using the unity game engine to simplify its visualization.

## Usage:

### From the unity editor

There are a number of buttons on the UI to edit the current `road network` with the pencil allowing you to create roads, the trashcan allows you to remove them and the traffic light is used to set up traffic lights in the
simulation. There are also buttons to quickly save and load road networks as well as a `photograph mode` which lets you view the roads from directly above.

### From the command line
